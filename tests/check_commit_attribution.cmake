# THE COMMIT-ATTRIBUTION CHECK (HIST-2) -- the `attribution` CI job.
#
# No SPDX header here on purpose: this repository carries no LICENSE file and no SPDX
# identifier on any tracked file, because Night Lab's licensing is an open question. A
# provenance guard is not the place to settle it, so this file follows the repository it
# is joining rather than the one it was ported from.
#
# The standing rule is that no AI assistant is ever recorded as a co-author of a Night Lab
# commit. The rule is a human instruction, and instructions have now failed in practice
# three times across this project: HIST-0 neutralised a first wave, HIST-1 removed a
# second wave of 14 commits from Loom, and HIST-2 removed 9 from Zengine and 4 from this
# repository's own `master`. A rule that has failed three times is not a rule, it is a
# hope. This is the mechanism.
#
# It is deliberately the SAME implementation Loom and Zengine carry in the same path, not
# a Night Lab variant of it. Each repository owns its own invariant -- there is no shared
# service and no cross-repository dependency -- but the predicate they own is one
# predicate, so that a reader who has understood it once has understood it everywhere.
#
# WHAT IT MATCHES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
#
# It asks git's OWN trailer parser for the Co-authored-by trailers of each commit and
# looks at their VALUES only. It therefore matches the thing that actually causes the
# attribution -- a real trailer in the trailer block, which is what GitHub reads -- and
# it cannot be tripped by prose. Discussing Claude in a commit message is normal and
# stays legal; the sentence you are reading would not trip it, and neither would a
# commit message describing this very check. Only the attribution itself is forbidden.
#
# It is keyed on the trailer VALUE, never on the trailer's presence: a Co-authored-by
# naming a human being is legitimate and must survive. A check that fired on the bare key
# would fail in the widening direction, refusing honest human collaborators.
#
# The forbidden set is the vendor and the product family, folded to lower case, not one
# model name: `claude` OR `anthropic`. Pinning "Claude Opus 5" would let "Claude Sonnet",
# "Claude Code" and a bare `noreply@anthropic.com` through on the next release, which is
# the widening failure again wearing a narrower mask. It stops there on purpose -- it is
# not a general AI-name blocklist, because that would start refusing human collaborators
# whose names happen to collide with a product.
#
# WHOLE HISTORY, NOT JUST THE NEW COMMITS
#
# It scans everything reachable from the ref rather than the commits an event happened
# to introduce. That is stronger and much simpler: no event-payload range arithmetic, no
# force-push or first-push edge cases, and the invariant it states is the one actually
# wanted -- NO commit reachable from this ref carries the attribution, not merely none
# of the ones pushed today. HIST-2 made that invariant true across all of master, so it
# is a floor the repository can hold from here rather than an aspiration. Narrow it with
# -DZEN_RANGE=<base>..<head> if a deliberately-retained attribution is ever adopted.
#
# WHY IT LIVES AT THE REPOSITORY ROOT AND NOT INSIDE AN EXPERIMENT
#
# This repository has no root build. It is four frozen historical areas pinned to four
# different Looms across four ABI generations, plus a live `current/` era in which every
# experiment is its own standalone CMake project and no file may be shared between two
# experiments. A history check belongs to none of them: it is a fact about the repository,
# not about any experiment's substrate, and hanging it off one experiment would both break
# that rule and tie a repository-wide invariant to one pin. It is also not a local git
# hook, because a hook that exists on one developer machine is a rule with the same
# failure mode as the one that already failed. It runs where the history is: in CI, on the
# hosted clone. It needs no Loom, no install prefix and no build, and is hand-runnable
# from the repository root:
#
#   cmake -P tests/check_commit_attribution.cmake
#
# THE SELF-TEST IS NOT OPTIONAL
#
# A clean repository and a broken detector produce byte-identical output, and after
# HIST-2 the repository IS clean -- so a passing run proves nothing at all unless the
# check has first been made to say NO. Before scanning anything real it manufactures two
# throwaway commit objects and requires the real code path to reach opposite verdicts on
# them: one carrying the forbidden attribution (must be caught) and one carrying a human
# co-author plus prose mentioning Claude (must NOT be caught, or the check has started
# refusing honest collaborators). Both are dangling objects -- no ref, no index, no
# working-tree change -- and git discards them at the next gc.
